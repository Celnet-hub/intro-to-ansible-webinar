The Ansible variable precedence is good to know about. 
It teaches both all the places you can organize your variables 
and tips and tricks that will be helpful as you get more experience.

It is good to have a baseline in the default "all" group (either in inventory or group_vars).

dist-sw01

The device is in group(s):

The site code for this device is:
